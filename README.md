Base PHP with Apache Docker Container
=====================================

### Fork by karfau

Simplifing images so they work for me when  developing a page using [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) in branches ending with `-grav-dev`.

Example `docker-compose.yml` inside the grav folder:
```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  php:
    build: path/to/local/clone/docker-php-apache-base
    volumes:
          - .:/var/www/html
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

- avoid using composer inside the docker image, or all (updated?) files will be owned by root
